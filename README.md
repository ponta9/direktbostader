###  Getting Started
Tested on Windows but i don't see why it should not work in Linux

On the first run the program will create a settings.ini file
Here is a example config

Example Config
```
[DEFAULT]
headless = true
interval = 30
url = https://www.studentbostader.se/sv/sok-bostad/lediga-bostader?actionId=&omraden=&egenskaper=SNABB&oboTyper=#&pagination=0&paginationantal=1000#
crashreportnotification = True

[Pushbullet]
enabled = True
firstpushbullet = False
token = o.ojfs9hjsehf3420i529562h34hu9234
emails = myEmail@domain.com,my2Email@domain.com

[Twilio]
enabled = true
firsttwilio = False
accountsid = ybdsahusdhqrhu3hurh9q3re3
authtoken = uh41hu43pfdhnufh223uh4r2
fromphonenumber = +46numberhere
tophonenumbers = +46numberhere,+46numberhere
```

Twilio is for receiving the info by SMS **P.S you can get free trial with more then enough balance**
Pushbullet is for receiving the info with a push notification on your phone


## Running the program
Run direktbostader.py

First time running a module(twilio/pushbullet) you should recive a welcome message on the service to check that it is working
Example "You will now receive a Pusbullet when a apartment becomes available on the provided link"

This how the program should look when running. Updating the current time when it checks(currently every 30 seconds)
